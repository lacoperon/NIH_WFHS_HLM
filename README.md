Data Analysis by @lacoperon (AKA Elliot Williams, Wesleyan '18)

#### The Dataset

The dataset itself is from the Work, Family and Health Study, run as a joint initiative between the NIH and the CDC; it aimed to better understand the "impact of workplace practices and policies on work, family life, and health outcomes."

Such a dataset lends itself to utilization of Hierarchical Linear Modeling, as the data itself is clearly organized into a hierarchy. Employees have managers, who themselves lead work groups within departments. To assume statistical independence among employees would be fallacious. 

So, this dataset is perfect microcosm for me to try out this new modeling technique.
